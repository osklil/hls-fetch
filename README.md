hls-fetch
=========

Introduction
------------

hls-fetch is a small program that downloads and decrypts HTTP Live Streaming
(HLS) videos. HLS is commonly used for streaming video on Apple iOS devices.

hls-fetch can download videos from web pages with embedded <video> tags,
from SVT Play (svtplay.se), or from M3U playlist directly. It will
decrypt streams if necessary and assemble individual segments, to produce a
single MPEG transport stream (.ts) file playable in most media players.

It is written in Perl.

Requirements
------------

 * Perl 5.10.0 (or later).
   Debian: perl

 * OpenSSL (only needed for encrypted streams).
   Debian: openssl

 * HTML::Parser Perl module.
   Debian: libhtml-parser-perl

 * LWP::UserAgent Perl module.
   Debian: libwww-perl

 * JSON Perl module.
   Debian: libjson-perl

 * URI Perl module.
   Debian: liburi-perl

Usage
-----

All you need to specify on the command line is the URL to fetch.
hls-fetch will download the page and look for a <video> tag.
If you know the M3U playlist URL, then use the --playlist parameter
along with the URL to tell hls-fetch to download the playlist
directly.

Run 'hls-fetch --help' for further usage information.

Future
------

On SIGINT and other terminating signals, make sure temporary files are removed.

Autodetect data in URL so that the --embedded/--playlist/--svtplay options are not
necessary.

Support SAMPLE-AES encryption method.
